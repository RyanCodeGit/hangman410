# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

## A Learning Experience
This is an implementation of the Hangman game in which you will be able to play hangman against your computer.

I will be testing my current knowledge of basic Python and Object Oriented Programming to create the game.
